A bare-bones utility bot that automatically responds to user questions

# About
This is a discord bot powered by JDA, but primarily written in Kotlin. I haven't tried running this on Railway, but it's unlikely that it'll work.

### Steps
- Create an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and convert it to a bot.
- Copy the bot token, and paste it into the ``example-config.yml`` file, under the ``"token"`` string.
- Copy the channel ID for your automated response channel, and paste it into the ``channel-id`` **as a long** (a number).
- Rename ``example-config.yml`` to ``config.yml``
- Run the bot on whatever hosting machine you're going to use

This is it for documentation, have fun
